  <b>A beautiful fork of wifi Maraduer, a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools for the 2.8'' ESP32 Module ESP32-2432S028R WiFi+BT Dual-core 240X320 Smart Display.</b>
  <b>This fork features a few great fixes and customzations.</b>
  
  <br>
  
  ## SD portal fix
  <b> This fix is to relocate all the portals for evil portal to a folder on the sd card. When you install marauder on the CYD all the protals used in evil portal get stored on the root of the sd card. To me this is a nuisance as all the pcap and other files that are captured while sniffing get thrown on the root of the sd as well. I have gone through and adjusted the code so you may create a folder titled "portals" and store the html files there.<br>In the <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff>Evil Portal</a> section are the files needed along with directions on usage. </b>
