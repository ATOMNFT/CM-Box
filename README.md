  <b>This repo will hold the flasher-tool to upload/flash a custom verion of <a href=hhttps://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/about>Wifi Marauder</a> along with 3D files to print different cases for the CYD AKA Cheap Yellow Display</b>
  <b>This build features a few great fixes and customzations.</b>
  
  <br>
  
  ## SD portal fix
  <b> This fix is to relocate all the portals for evil portal to a folder on the sd card. When you install marauder on the CYD all the protals used in evil portal get stored on the root of the sd card. To me this is a nuisance as all the pcap and other files that are captured while sniffing get thrown on the root of the sd as well. I have gone through and adjusted the code so you may create a folder titled "portals" and store the html files there.<br>In the <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff>Evil Portal</a> section are the files needed along with directions on usage. </b>
  
  
  
  ## To install this fork of marauder
